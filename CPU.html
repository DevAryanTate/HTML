    <p>The first commercially available CPU, the Intel 4004, was <mark>invented by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Faggin"> Federico faggin</a></mark> and released by
        Intel in
        1971. It was a revolutionary chip, effectively a "computer on a chip," and it launched the microprocessor
        revolution. Faggin also developed the silicon gate technology (SGT) used in the 4004.

    <h2>Components of CPU</h2>
    <p><strong>CPU</strong> consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit">The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit">The Control Unit (CU)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register">Registers</a></li>

    <p>Hardwired into a CPU's circuitry is a set of basic operations it can perform, called an instruction set. Such
        operations may involve, for example, adding or subtracting two numbers, comparing two numbers, or jumping to a
        different part of a program. Each instruction is represented by a unique combination of bits, known as the
        machine language opcode. While processing an instruction, the CPU decodes the opcode (via a binary decoder) into
        control signals, which orchestrate the behavior of the CPU. A complete machine language instruction consists of
        an opcode and, in many cases, additional bits that specify arguments for the operation (for example, the numbers
        to be summed in the case of an addition operation). Going up the complexity scale, a machine language program is
        a collection of machine language instructions that the CPU executes.</p>

    <h2>Types of CPU</h2>
    <p>CPUs come in different types, depending on how many cores they have. A core is like a mini-CPU inside the main
        CPU, and more cores mean the CPU can do more tasks at once. Here are the main types:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single-Core CPU</strong>The oldest type, used in the 1970s. It can only handle one task at a time,
            so it’s slow for modern apps like games or web browsers.</li>
        <li><strong>Dual-Core CPU:</strong>Has two cores, so it can handle two tasks at once. It’s faster and better for
            multitasking, like listening to music while doing homework.</li>
        <li><strong>Quad-Core CPU:</strong>Has four cores, making it great for heavy tasks like video editing or playing
            modern games. It’s very fast and common in today’s computers.</li>
